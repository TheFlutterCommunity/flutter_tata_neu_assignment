# Tata Neu Home Page Assignment
A Flutter application to showcase Tata Neu Home Page.

## **Assignment Overview**
In this assignment, I mainly focused on good Project architecture (that helps with project scalability and easy maintenance), state management, modularity, naming convention and optimizations etc. I tried to make this assignment as a real project by using mock API, localization, custom components, Navigator 2.0, constants and custom fonts etc.

For developing the Tata Neu Home page, below main packages are used:
#### **Architecture**:
*MVVM*
#### **State Management**:
*Provider with get_it*
#### **API Communication**:
*retrofit, dio, build_runner, json_serializable, retrofit_generator*
#### **Multi Language**:
*flutter_localizations*
#### **App Icon**:
*flutter_launcher_icons*

## Note
Sorry for the late submission as I already conveyed the situation to **Shrey**. My client's project was in the **beta release phase** and I had to **stretch a lot** for making the project delivery successful by **working on weekends** also with **health issue**.

I got less time to focus on this assignment so this delay occurred. I tried a lot to make this **assignment as a real project** within a **limited** time.
